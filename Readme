# Churn Prediction Model

## Overview

The Churn Prediction Model is a machine learning-based solution that analyzes customer data to predict churn percentages. It leverages a trained model to forecast potential churn risks, making it useful for businesses to identify customers likely to leave.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Processes customer data for insights.
- **Churn Prediction**: Uses a trained machine learning model.
- **Backend Implementation**: Developed using Python libraries.
- **API Support**: Provides an API interface for model interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** - For serving the API
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd churn-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset in CSV format.
2. Run the model to analyze and predict churn:
   ```sh
   python churn_random.py
   ```
3. Start the API server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Send requests to the API to get predictions.
